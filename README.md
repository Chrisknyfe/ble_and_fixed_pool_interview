# ble_and_fixed_pool_interview
A take-home response to an interview question about remembering bluetooth addresses. I decided to make the response a little silly by adding an off-the-cuff implementation of a fixed memory pool. Only really here for bragging rights. See proprietary_ble.c for the problem description and an implementation of the fixed memory pool.
